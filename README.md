# Todo

## A todo frontend written in react for [fharding1/todo](https://github.com/fharding1/todo)

I figured I should learn at least the basics of react, so I wrote a (very minimal with no styling) frontend for a backend I wrote. Feel free to check it out, but be aware I'm not that experienced in react, or even javascript.
